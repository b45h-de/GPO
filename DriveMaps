To Map Drives via GPO create a new GPO.
Navigate to User Configuration --> Preferences --> Windows Settings --> Drive Maps
Right Click on the right pane and select new --> mapped drive for every drive you want to map.

Selection on the General Tab:
Action: Update
Location: \\server\share
Recconnect: checked

If you want the drive to be mapped if a user is member of a specific group:
On the common tab you can select item-level targeting and click on targeting
Now click on new element and select security group.
Select the group you want to check against in the lower pane via the "..." Button and
click "ok" when done.

One thing you probably also want to do is to remove the drives when the user isn't in the
specified group for a drive anymore.
In this case we create an additional mapped drive to delete the drive.
The easiest way is to just create a copy of the drive in the gpo
and Update the Action from Update to Remove/Delete in the General Tab.

For this to work the targeting also has to be updated.
Click on the targeting button as described above.
Select the created Element, select Element options and select is not.
Now the targeting checks if a user isn't memeber of a group and removes the drive
if true.
Click on "ok" when done.

As far as I can tell from research the easier way to do a map and remove is to
set the options to map the drive in the user context and remove the item if not applied
anymore in the common tab.
In this case the there would only be one Mapped drive item necessary in the gpo per drive.
But this doesn't seem to work in my tests.
